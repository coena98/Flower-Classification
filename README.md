# Flower-Classification
This is a complete project on Kaggle's dataset of Flower Recognition. The project studies three models of CNN namely - a CNN model from scratch, a VGG19 model and finally a Resent50 model with  transfer learning. The inspiration for this project is taken from a Medium article by Yinghan Xu which can be found https://medium.com/@rockyxu399/three-models-for-kaggles-flowers-recognition-dataset-bc2ff732cf4e. I have also done a comparative  study between generating datasets using "tf.keras.preprocessing.image_dataset_from_directory" and manually.
